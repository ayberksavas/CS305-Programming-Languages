# CS305-Programming-Languages
This repository includes my solutions and projects developed as part of the CS305 course at SabancÄ± University. 

Throughout the course, I have been using PowerShell as our working environment, and I have also gained familiarity with Linux-based commands and workflows. So far, I have implemented lexical analyzers using Flex and parsers using Bison, applying them to various assignments and mini-projects that demonstrate my understanding of compiler construction principles.
